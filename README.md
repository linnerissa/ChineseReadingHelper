# ChineseReadingHelper

When learning to read chinese, having natural language segmentation can help a reader better understand the language phrasing. This Proof of Concept that grabs a sample article and gets the segmentation, pronunciation, and translation of these phrases on demand. This can help a reader more easily get a feel for the language choices and building blocks used in written language. The react app shows buttons for each ciyu which has pinyin when hovered and grabs translation when the button is clicked - these translations are fetched on demand.

This was mostly meant to be a learning exploration into:
✔ Learn to use React and Express\
✔ Create a Webapp as initial prototype to demonstrate proof of concept\
✔ Deploy using Heroku\
❓ Make a Chrome extension that only applies this to all Xinhuanet articles (Done in another repo! CRH-Extension)
